# Theme

The light and dark theme of the application can be toggled using the theme button on the navigation bar.

The value, `@clrfund/vue-app.light-theme = true|false`, indicating whether light theme is selected, will be persisted to the browser local storage.

The existing vuex store is used to make the selected theme accessible to all components
